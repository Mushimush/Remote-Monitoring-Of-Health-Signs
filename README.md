<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Cardiovascular diseases are a significant cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Unfortunately, the lack of accessible self-monitoring devices often results in neglected vital sign measurements.

Physical changes, such as variations in facial color caused by heartbeat, are too subtle to be detected by the naked eye. However, by using a simple camera input and image processing techniques, these health signs can be accurately estimated, eliminating the need for external devices.

This project aims to develop a system that can estimate three critical vital signs: Heart Rate, Respiration Rate, and Blood Pressure, with high accuracy and reliability.
